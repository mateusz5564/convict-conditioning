## About

It's a calisthenics app. In a nutshell, calisthenics is training with your body weight with no or little equipment, for example, push-ups or squats. This app is based on the book Convict Conditioning by Paul Wade. 
The plan proposed in this book consists of six exercises: push-ups, leg raises, squats, pull-ups, handstands, and bridges. Each group has ten exercises, sorted from the easiest to the hardest. Every exercise has three levels (number of series and reps), when we reach the 3rd level, we can move to the next exercise which is a little bit harder. When you complete this plan you'll be able to do crazy things with your body, like one-leg squat or one-arm handstand :)
So this app is created to allow us to track and visualize our workout progress.
